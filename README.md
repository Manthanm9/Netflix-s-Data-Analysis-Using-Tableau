## Introduction:
In this data analysis project, we explored Netflix's data collected from multiple web sources and utilized SQL for data management and cleaning. Our ultimate goal was to gain valuable insights into Netflix's content library and user engagement patterns. To achieve this, we connected the cleaned data to Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create compelling visuals and an insightful dashboard.

## Data Collection and Cleaning:
We started by gathering data from various web sources, ensuring we had comprehensive information about Netflix's content, including titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more. With the collected data, we performed data cleaning and transformation using SQL. This step involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting the data to make it suitable for analysis.

## Creating Visuals in Tableau:
After cleaning the data, we seamlessly integrated it with Tableau to begin the visualization process. Tableau's user-friendly interface and extensive visualization capabilities allowed us to create insightful charts, graphs, and other visual representations.

## Visual Insights:
1. Content Distribution by Genre: We visualized Netflix's content distribution by genre using a bar chart. This helped us identify the most prevalent genres in the platform's library.

2. Content Release Trend: A line chart displayed the trend of content releases over time. We could analyze whether Netflix was adding more content each year and spot any seasonal patterns.

3. User Engagement: To understand user engagement, we created a pie chart illustrating the distribution of viewer ratings. This allowed us to gauge the popularity of content based on user ratings.

4. Top-Rated Titles: We showcased the top-rated titles using a horizontal bar chart. This provided an overview of the most popular and well-received shows or movies on Netflix.

5. User Preferences: A heat map visualized the user preferences, indicating which genres were watched most frequently. This helped identify audience preferences and content popularity.

## The Final Dashboard:
Our final dashboard presented a comprehensive view of Netflix's content library and user engagement. The visuals were thoughtfully arranged and formatted for easy interpretation. We included interactive filters that enabled users to drill down into specific categories, genres, or time frames to gain deeper insights into the data.
